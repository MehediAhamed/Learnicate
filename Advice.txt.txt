Always keep it simple — Don't make things harder than they have to be. 
Simplify everything when possible. 
Don't get attached to stuff — Nothing lasts forever,
so don't base your happiness on materialistic things.
Choose experience over things — The impact they have over your life will last you a lifetime guaranteed.
